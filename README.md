# Crawler for skin cancer images

This project attempts to create a crawler for dermoscopic images of skin cancer.
This includes both frontend and backend.

The backend consists of packages to crawl images from websites and a web server
to collect them and serve the images as an API.

The frontend consumes the API and displays information to the user.
